Create a variable called "var1" that holds a random number between 25-50.
  $var1 = get-random -minimum 25 -maximum 50
Create a variable called "var2" that holds a random number between 1-10.
  $var2 = get-random -minimum 1 -maximum 10
Create a variable called "sum" that holds the sum of var1 and var2.
  $sum = $var1 + $var2

##DAY 2
Create an array containing a range with a random starting and stopping point. The starting point will be a random number from -10 through 0. The ending point will be a random number from 1 through 20.
  $a= get-random -minimum -10 -maximum 0

  $c= $a..$b
Create a variable that contains the contents of the array in reverse
  echo [array]::Reverse($c)

Create two empty hash tables with the following names:

employee1

employee2

Using the following table of key-value pairs, apply each key-value to the empty hash tables.

Table 1. keys and values
First	Last	ID	Job
Mary

Hopper

001

Software Developer

John

Williams

002

Web Developer

The keys on the first row of the table while the values are on the first column of the table

Now add a new key called Username which holds a contraction of the employeeâ€™s first initial then last name then ID. (i.e. mhopper001).

Mary got promoted to "Software Lead" so the job key for Mary needs to be changed to "Software Lead"

Create a new hash table called "employee3" that contains the following values with the respective keys.

Table 2. employee3
First	Last	ID	Job
Alex

Moran

003

Software Developer

Add a new key called "Status" that holds the values:

Table 3. Status
Mary	John	Alex
Management

Intermediate

Entry Level

Make sure you use both dot notation and square brackets to manipulate your hash tables.
