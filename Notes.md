Create a variable called "var1" that holds a random number between 25-50.
  $var1 = get-random -minimum 25 -maximum 50
Create a variable called "var2" that holds a random number between 1-10.
  $var2 = get-random -minimum 1 -maximum 10
Create a variable called "sum" that holds the sum of var1 and var2.
  $sum = $var1 + $var2
Create a variable called "sub" that holds the difference of var1 and var2.
  $sub = $var1 - $var2
Create a variable called "prod" that holds the product of var1 and var2.
  $prod = $var1 * $var2
Create a variable called "quo" that holds the quotient of var1 and var2.
  $quo = $var1 / $var2
Replace the variables in text with their values in the following format:

"var1" + "var2" = "sum"
write-host -nonewline $var1 + $var2 = $sum
Replace the variables in text with their values in the following format:

"var1" - "var2" = "sub"
write-host -nonewline $var1 - $var2 = $sub
Replace the variables in text with their values in the following format:

"var1" * "var2" = "prod"
write-host -nonewline $var1 * $var2 = $prod
Replace the variables in text with their values in the following format:

"var1" / "var2" = "quo"
write-host -nonewline $var1 / $var2 = $quo

##DAY 2
Create an array containing a range with a random starting and stopping point. The starting point will be a random number from -10 through 0. The ending point will be a random number from 1 through 20.
  $a= get-random -minimum -10 -maximum 0
  $b= get-random -minimum 1 -maximum 20
  $c= $a..$b
Create a variable that contains the contents of the array in reverse
  echo [array]::Reverse($c)

Create two empty hash tables with the following names:

employee1

employee2

Using the following table of key-value pairs, apply each key-value to the empty hash tables.

Table 1. keys and values
First	Last	ID	Job
Mary

Hopper

001

Software Developer

John

Williams

002

Web Developer

The keys on the first row of the table while the values are on the first column of the table

Now add a new key called Username which holds a contraction of the employeeâ€™s first initial then last name then ID. (i.e. mhopper001).

Mary got promoted to "Software Lead" so the job key for Mary needs to be changed to "Software Lead"

Create a new hash table called "employee3" that contains the following values with the respective keys.

Table 2. employee3
First	Last	ID	Job
Alex

Moran

003

Software Developer

Add a new key called "Status" that holds the values:

Table 3. Status
Mary	John	Alex
Management

Intermediate

Entry Level

Make sure you use both dot notation and square brackets to manipulate your hash tables.

$employee1 = [ordered]@{}
$employee2 = [ordered]@{}

$emplyee1.First = "Mary"
$employee1["Last"] = "Hopper"
$employee1.ID = "001"
$employee1["Job"] = "Software Developer"
$employee1.Username = "mhopper001"
$employee1.Job = "Software Lead"
$employee1.Status = "Management"

$emplyee2.First = "John"
$employee2["Last"] = "Williams"
$employee2.ID = "002"
$employee2["Job"] = "Web Developer"
$employee2.Username = "jwilliams002"
$employee2.Status = "Intermediate"

$emplyee3.First = "Alex"
$employee3["Last"] = "Moran"
$employee3.ID = "003"
$employee3["Job"] = "Software Developer"
$employee3.Username = "amoran003"
$employee3.Status = "Entry Level"

Display the start time of the earliest and latest running processes
  Get-Process | Sort-Object starttime | Select-Object -First 1 -Last 1 | ft processname, starttime
Identify a cmdlet that returns the current date and time then using this cmdlet and Select-object, display only the current day of the week
  Get-Date | ft DayofWeek
Identify a cmdlet that displays a list of installed hotfixes.
  get-hotfix
Extend the expression to sort the list by install date, and display only the install date and hotfix ID.
  Get-HotFix | Sort-Object -Property InstalledOn | ft InstalledOn, HotFixID
Extend the expression further, but this time sort by description, include description, hotfix ID, and install Date.
  Get-HotFix | Sort-Object -Property Description | ft Description, HotFixID, InstalledOn

Create a custom object that contains information about the host system using the following:

Win32_ComputerSystem

Win32_BIOS

Win32_OperatingSystem

Win32_LogicalDisk

Use the cmdlet Get-WmiObject to obtain the needed information

Store the objects results into variables to be used in the custom object

The custom object will only contain properties not methods

The final output of this exercise should look like the following:

Endstate
ComputerName    : DESKTOP-5KJDVS2
OperatingSystem : Microsoft Windows 10 Pro
Version         : 10.0.17134
Manufacturer    : Dell Inc.
Disks           : {\\DESKTOP-                          5KJDVS2\root\cimv2:Win32_LogicalDisk.DeviceID="C:",
                  \\DESKTOP-5KJDVS2\root\cimv2:Win32_LogicalDisk.DeviceID="D:"}

$ComputerInformation = [PSCustomObject]@{
    "ComputerName" = (Get-WmiObject Win32_ComputerSystem).name
    "OperatingSystem" = (get-ciminstance win32_operatingsystem).Caption
    "Version" = (Get-WmiObject Win32_OperatingSystem).Version
    "Manufacturer" = (Get-WmiObject win32_BIOS).Manufacturer
    "Disks" = Get-WmiObject win32_logicaldisk
}         

Output:
  ComputerName    : WIN-OPS
  OperatingSystem : Microsoft Windows 10 Pro
  Version         : 10.0.19045
  Manufacturer    : Microsoft Corporation
  Disks           : {\\WIN-OPS\root\cimv2:Win32_LogicalDisk.DeviceID="C:", \\WIN-OPS\root\cimv2:Win32_LogicalDisk.DeviceID="D:"}
